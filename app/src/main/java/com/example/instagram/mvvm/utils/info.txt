Flow of Interaction
App Starts:

MainActivity initializes HomeFragment.
Fetching Posts:

HomeFragment observes postsLiveData in PostViewModel.
PostViewModel fetches posts from PostRepository.
PostRepository returns a LiveData list of posts.
When data changes, postsLiveData is updated, and the UI is automatically refreshed.
Displaying Posts:

HomeFragment passes the post list to PostAdapter.
PostAdapter binds each post to a RecyclerView item (image, video, like count, etc.).
User Interaction:

Liking a Post:
User clicks the "Like" button in a post item.
PostAdapter notifies HomeFragment through PostClickListener.
HomeFragment calls PostViewModel.likePost().
PostViewModel updates the repository, which modifies the data and triggers UI updates.
Commenting on a Post:
User clicks the "Comment" button in a post item.
The flow is similar to liking but includes adding a comment to the repository.
Dynamic Updates:

LiveData ensures the UI always reflects the latest data (e.g., updated like counts or added comments).
